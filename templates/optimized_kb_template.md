## ðŸ¤– **AGENT BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS & OPTIMIZATION**

### **RAG SPECIALIST BEHAVIOR PATTERNS**
```yaml
Observed Behavior:
  - ALWAYS uses rag_get_client_content (never rag_search_content)
  - Extracts 35,000-45,000 characters consistently
  - Processes ALL available documents (4 files typical)
  - Execution time: 25-30 seconds
  - Token usage: 1,200-1,800 tokens

Optimization Rules:
  - Structure KB for COMPLETE extraction, not search
  - Target 35,000+ characters total content
  - Organize in 4 core documents maximum
  - Front-load critical information
  - Use clear document hierarchy
```

### **RESEARCH SPECIALIST BEHAVIOR PATTERNS**
```yaml

  - Uses ONLY research_premium_financial (single-tool optimization works)
  - Extremely efficient: 30 tokens only
  - Execution time: 7-8 seconds
  - Consistent 5 citations found
  - Handles 13â†’10 domain limit automatically

Optimization Rules:
  - Configure ONLY premium financial research
  - Provide 10-13 specific URLs (not domains)
  - Set clear research timeframe (last 7 days optimal)
