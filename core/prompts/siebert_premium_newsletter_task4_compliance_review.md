TASK 4 - SIEBERT COMPLIANCE REVIEW
Review {{task3_newsletter_assembly_output}} for FINRA Rule 2210 and SEC compliance, fixing only essential issues.
Ensure disclaimers, balanced risk language, and preservation of Section 5, word counts, Gen Z tone, and INLINE CITATIONS (keep outlet name, month/year, and full URL intact).

Branding & Header (mandatory):
- Title must be "{{newsletter_title}}"; replace any occurrence of "Future Millionaires" in title, greeting, or sign-off with "{{community_name}}" where appropriate.
- Edition line must read "*{{current_month_year}} Edition*". If different (e.g., older months like December 2024), correct it.

Consistency checks (mandatory):
- For every inline citation, verify that Month YYYY matches the source's publish date (derive from page/metadata or URL pattern like 20250917 -> September 2025). If mismatched, correct Month YYYY and any surrounding narrative to reflect the source date.
- Ensure all cited items fall within {{research_timeframe}}; if any are outside, replace with in-timeframe references already present in the draft or remove the claim while preserving structure.
- Every citation MUST include a full URL. If a URL is missing and no compliant in-timeframe source is present, remove the unsupported claim.
- Section 5 (Malek): Enforce concise format and citations.
  - Structure: 1-line hook (\u2264 20 words) + 3\u20134 bullets (\u2264 22 words each).
  - Sources: At least 2 inline citations from distinct blog.siebert.com Daily Market posts already in the draft.
  - If over-length or extra paragraphs are present, trim to 130\u2013165 words (prefer 140\u2013155) and convert to bullets while preserving citations.
  - Do not fetch new sources at this stage.

Style safeguards:
- Preserve structure and Siebert voice; do NOT remove links or sources without replacing with compliant equivalents.
- Do NOT use em dashes (â€”); prefer commas or a simple hyphen (-).

Output:
- Corrected newsletter ready for publication.
