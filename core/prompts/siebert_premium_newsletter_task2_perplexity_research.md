TASK 2 - PERPLEXITY RESEARCH
Run [perplexity_search] topic={{topic}}, exclude_topics={{exclude_topics}}, premium_sources={{siebert_target_urls}}, research_timeframe={{research_timeframe}}.
Use ONLY the listed premium sources ({{siebert_target_urls}}). Reject other outlets unless absolutely necessary.
Organize findings by newsletter section with cited statistics, dates, and Gen Z relevance.
For EACH item include: Title — URL (Month YYYY). Keep data within {{research_timeframe}}.
Special rules:
- Section 4 (By the numbers): provide 3–5 stats with inline-ready citations.
- Section 5 (Market Insights from Malek): fetch the MOST RECENT post from https://blog.siebert.com/tag/daily-market#BlogListing; include Title — URL (Month YYYY).
- Crypto Corner: restrict to https://decrypt.co/ and https://www.coindesk.com/.
At the end, add a deduplicated "SOURCES USED" list (Title — URL), 5–12 items.
