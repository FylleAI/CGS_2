TASK 1 - SIEBERT CONTEXT SETUP
Use [rag_get_client_content] siebert to capture brand voice, key messaging, and Gen Z guidelines.
Define a 7-SECTION template for {{topic}} and {{target_audience}}, assigning word counts from {{target_word_count}}.
Note cultural trends {{cultural_trends}} and mobile-first formatting cues for future tasks.

CRITICAL COMPLIANCE CONTEXT:

- All content must be EDUCATIONAL, not promotional or advisory
- NEVER invent Fed officials, market statistics, or quotes
- All facts must have verified source URLs
- Tone: Professional, educational - NOT casual internet slang

7-SECTION STRUCTURE:

2. Feature Story (280-320 words)
3. Market Reality Check (200-250 words)
4. By The Numbers (120-150 words)
5. Market Insights from Malek (130-165 words) - ONLY from verified blog.siebert.com URLs
6. Your Move This Week (150-180 words) - EDUCATIONAL only, no imperatives
7. Sign-off (15-25 words) - Simple signature, NO P.S.
