# Real Estate Compliance Considerations

## Key Regulatory Themes
- **Disclosure Standards**: Ensure property listings include accurate energy performance ratings, occupancy certificates, and known structural issues.
- **Financial Promotions**: Investment-oriented content must clarify risks, projected yields, and assumptions in accordance with local financial authorities.
- **Data Protection**: Customer data collected through Reopla experiences must follow GDPR consent requirements and secure storage practices.

## Regional Highlights
- Italy requires energy performance certificates (APE) to be shared prior to listing publication.
- Spain mandates transparency around short-term rental licensing status in most municipalities.
- France enforces strict lead paint disclosures for properties built before 1949.

## Compliance Best Practices
1. Include disclaimers when referencing future market performance or investment returns.
2. Avoid promising guaranteed yields; frame outcomes as projections with clear inputs.
3. Align imagery with property availability and avoid misrepresenting amenities.
4. Maintain audit logs of all marketing materials and approvals within Reopla's transaction workspace.
